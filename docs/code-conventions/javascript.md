# JavaScript conventions

## Naming

Be sure to read our [naming conventions](general-naming.md).

## Quotes

Always use double quotes for string literals, unless

* the JS code itself is part of an HTML attribute or
* you need to use double quotes inside the string without escaping them with backslashes.

Both cases should occur rarely.
